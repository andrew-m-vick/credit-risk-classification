# Credit Risk Analysis Report

The primary goal of this analysis is to build a model that can accurately predict both healthy and high-risk loans. The model's performance was assessed using the following metrics:

- Accuracy Score: 0.99
- Precision (Healthy Loan): 1.00
- Recall (Healthy Loan): 1.00
- Precision (High-Risk Loan): 0.87
- Recall (High-Risk Loan): 0.95

Based on the metrics, I would recommend this logistic regression model for use by the company. The model is 100% accurate at predicting healthy loans, and it is highly accurate with high-risk loans. The high accuracy of this model makes it a valuable tool for the company.
